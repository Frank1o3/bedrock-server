## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues
- Use the [GitHub Issues](../../issues) page to report bugs, request features, or suggest improvements.
- Before opening a new issue, please check if it already exists to avoid duplicates.
- When reporting a bug, include:
  - Clear description of the problem.
  - Steps to reproduce it.
  - Your environment (OS, version, etc.).
  - Any relevant logs or error messages.

### Suggesting Features
- Open an issue with the `feature request` label.
- Explain the use case, why it’s needed, and possible implementation ideas.

### Submitting Code
1. **Fork the Repository**  
   Create your own fork and work from there.

2. **Create a Branch**  
   Use descriptive branch names:  
   `fix/bug-description` or `feature/new-feature-name`.

3. **Make Your Changes**  
   - Write clear, maintainable code.
   - Follow the existing style and structure of the project.
   - Include comments where necessary.

4. **Commit Messages**  
   Keep commits concise but descriptive. Example:  
   - `fix: corrected null pointer on startup`  
   - `feat: added player data persistence`

5. **Pull Requests (PRs)**  
   - Push your branch and open a PR against `main`.  
   - Describe what you changed and why.  
   - Reference related issues (if any).  
   - Ensure your PR is focused — one feature/bug per PR.

## Code Style

- Follow the conventions already present in the codebase.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Keep formatting consistent (indentation, spacing, etc.).
- Avoid large, unrelated changes in a single PR.

---

## Tests

- If your contribution affects critical functionality, please add or update tests.
- Ensure existing tests pass before submitting a PR.

---

## Communication

- For major changes, open an issue first to discuss the idea.  
- This helps avoid duplicated effort or changes that don’t fit the project’s scope.
