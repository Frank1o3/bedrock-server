### REMOVED FEATURES

tyelAbout.changelog121=v1.2.1
tyelAbout.changelog121.title=§7THE "DEPRESSED CLEAR HOVERER" UPDATE
tyelAbout.changelog121.notice1=§cPlease note that this update does not have any new localization supports.
tyelAbout.changelog121.notice2=Note: As JSON UI is being replaced by Ore UI day-by-day, it means that we are nearing the end of Ty-el UI (JSON UI Edition). Unless Mojang allows us to customize Ore UI with resource packs, most screens won't be customizable anymore, including the Bed Screen and Play Screen. It's something I can't help players to pass through. §osorry

### NEW FEATURES
tyelAbout.changelog121.label1=- Added the "Clear Recipe" button to non-controller players, allow players to quickly move all items inside the crafting grid to your inventory in just one click. This feature is already a vanilla feature on controller mode and therefore does not need to be made for controller players as a duplicate.
tyelAbout.changelog121.label2=- Added the ability to toggle item hover text visibility, can be enabled in Container Toolbox.
tyelAbout.changelog121.label3=- It's now possible to see exact bundle "weights" in HUD and when the bundle item is selected in inventory.
tyelAbout.changelog121.label4=- Added the missing "Account Profile" button to the Start Screen Sidebar, as well as the "Servers" button as another "quick" button to open Play Screen/Servers tab.
tyelAbout.changelog121.label5=- It's now possible to enable/disable HUD chunk position/chunk border features by setting Pack Options to "Performance" or disabling global variable "$use_hud_advanced_position_texts".

tyelAbout.changelog121.label9=§7  + "$use_classic_hover_text_on_touch": (Touch only) Toggle between classic hover text mode (next to selected item) and touch mode hover text (always at the bottom of the screen).
tyelAbout.changelog121.label10=§7  + "$use_hud_advanced_position_texts": Enable Chunk Position and Chunk Border features, disabling this can improve performance.
tyelAbout.changelog121.label11=§7  + "$container_toolbox_always_visible": Container Toolbox always visible by default. (This will hide the original toggle if set to true, Classic UI only, on Pocket UI it's always visible by design.)
