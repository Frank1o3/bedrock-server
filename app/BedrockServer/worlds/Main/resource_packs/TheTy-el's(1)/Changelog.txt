v1.2.1 (111)-2024.12.24-(r1.21.51)
THE "DEPRESSED CLEAR HOVERER" UPDATE
Please note that this update does not have any new localization supports.
Note: As JSON UI is being replaced by Ore UI day-by-day, it means that we are nearing the end of Ty-el UI (JSON UI Edition). Unless Mojang allows us to customize Ore UI with resource packs, most screens won't be customizable anymore, including the Bed Screen and Play Screen. It's something I can't help players to pass through.

### NEW FEATURES
- Added the "Clear Recipe" button to non-controller players, allow players to quickly move all items inside the crafting grid to your inventory in just one click. This feature is already a vanilla feature on controller mode and therefore does not need to be made for controller players as a duplicate.
- Added the ability to toggle item hover text visibility, can be enabled in Container Toolbox.
- It's now possible to see exact bundle "weights" in HUD and when the bundle item is selected in inventory.
- Added the missing "Account Profile" button to the Start Screen Sidebar, as well as the "Servers" button as another "quick" button to open Play Screen/Servers tab.
- It's now possible to enable/disable HUD chunk position/chunk border features by setting Pack Options to "Performance" or disabling global variable "$use_hud_advanced_position_texts".
* NEW GLOBAL VARIABLES
- Added these new global variables to "/ui/_global_variables.json" for pack customization:
  + "$toggleable_hover_text_default_state": customize the default state of "Toggle Item Hover Text Visibility".
  + "$use_classic_hover_text_on_touch": (Touch only) Toggle between classic hover text mode (next to selected item) and touch mode hover text (always at the bottom of the screen).
  + "$use_hud_advanced_position_texts": Enable Chunk Position and Chunk Border features, disabling this can improve performance.
  + "$container_toolbox_always_visible": Container Toolbox always visible by default. (This will hide the original toggle if set to true, Classic UI only, on Pocket UI it's always visible by design.)

### CHANGES
- Updated Container Toolbox display layout on some Pocket UI screens to fix some problems that cause buttons to be overlapped each other.

### FIXES
- Fixed some pack errors since the game was updated to v1.21.50+
- Fixed an issue that causes the game to crash when the Mob Effect screen is opened.
- Reverted a change to store filter/sort menu popups that cause both menus to be invisible when being opened.
- Miscellaneous screen layouts and improvements bug fixes.

============================================================
